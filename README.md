# Pachink - Godot Game

This is a simple version of the popular Japanese game, Pachinko.

This version was made as a fun side project to learn python game developement originally, but after speaking with different people, we agreed to see how easy it would be to recreate in Godot. 

This project is only a simplified version of the pachinko game, made over a few hours spanding a few days.

## Additions that would be nice

- Multiple gamemodes
    - Normal
        - Get the highscore using the asserted amount of drops allowed at your own pace.
    - Competition
        - A simple way to compete for the fun of the game. Set the score the amount of drops allowed before the next competitor.   

## Created Using
